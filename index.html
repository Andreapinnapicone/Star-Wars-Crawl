              A boy named Andrea lost all hope,
              he wanted to learn about coding.
              But he had a hard time finding something
              so he abandonned the idea and started to search for a job. 
            </p>
            <p>
              While searching he heard about "BeCode"
              a 6 month training where he could finally
              do something he really likes. So he went on BeCode's website
              to fill the incription form. After a couple days waiting
              for an awnser, he received an email telling him that he was 
              on a "waiting list" and once again hopeless he started again
              his researches for a job. Until the day after he received another email
              telling him that he was accepted.
            </p>
            <p>
              He started on May the 2nd, he met a lot of nice people,
              and was really happy about that training. In a couple of weeks he  
              learned more than he never thought he would.
              But we'll know more about that later...
